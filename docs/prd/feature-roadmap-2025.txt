FOREX SESSION TRADING DASHBOARD - FEATURE ROADMAP 2025
================================================================================
Generated: November 2025
Target Users: Forex Day Traders & Institutional Traders
Research Base: Current market trends, trader pain points, competitive analysis

================================================================================
TOP 5 PRIORITY FEATURES - START HERE (3-4 Week Sprint)
================================================================================

1. POSITION SIZE & RISK CALCULATOR ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
   ---------------------------------------------------
   WHY: Poor risk management is the #1 reason traders fail. Research shows
        most traders focus on profits and ignore proper position sizing.
        Professional tools lack this with modern, intuitive UIs.

   FEATURES:
   - Account balance input field
   - Risk percentage per trade (recommended 1-3%)
   - Stop-loss distance calculator (in pips)
   - Currency pair selection dropdown
   - Real-time calculation output:
     * Recommended lot size (standard/mini/micro)
     * Pip value in account currency
     * Maximum loss amount
   - Save/load preset risk profiles

   INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES:
   - Connect with economic calendar: Auto-suggest reducing risk before
     high-impact news events
   - Session awareness: Recommend smaller positions during low-liquidity sessions
   - Alert system: Warn when calculated risk exceeds recommended limits

   TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - New React component: RiskCalculator.tsx
   - Formula: Position Size = (Account Balance × Risk %) / (Stop Loss in Pips × Pip Value)
   - No external APIs required
   - Store user preferences in localStorage or PostgreSQL

   USER BENEFIT: Enforces discipline, prevents emotional "revenge trading",
                 reduces account blowouts


2. VOLATILITY INDICATORS BY SESSION
   ---------------------------------
   WHY: You show WHEN sessions are active, but not their volatility
        characteristics. Traders need to know BOTH timing AND intensity.
        Research shows average daily range increased 20% in 2025.

   FEATURES:
   - Historical average pip movement per session
   - Real-time volatility meter (current vs. historical average)
   - Color-coded intensity levels:
     * Green: Low volatility (< 50 pips)
     * Yellow: Medium volatility (50-100 pips)
     * Orange: High volatility (100-150 pips)
     * Red: Extreme volatility (> 150 pips)
   - Session comparison: "London Killzone averaging 127 pips today vs. 95 avg"

   DISPLAY OPTIONS:
   - Overlay on existing session timeline chart as intensity bars
   - Dedicated volatility panel below charts
   - Numeric indicators next to session names

   DATA SOURCE:
   - Calculate from historical price data (if available)
   - Integrate ATR (Average True Range) calculations
   - Could use free APIs like Alpha Vantage or Twelve Data

   TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - New data layer in PostgreSQL for volatility metrics
   - Backend API endpoint: /api/volatility/session
   - Enhanced ForexChart.tsx with volatility overlay
   - Update every 15-30 minutes

   USER BENEFIT: Helps traders choose optimal entry times, adjust position
                 sizing based on conditions, avoid overtrading during
                 consolidation


3. SESSION COUNTDOWN & BROWSER ALERTS
   -----------------------------------
   WHY: 43% of traders now use automation. Traders cannot watch screens
        constantly but need to know when key moments approach.

   FEATURES:
   - Browser push notifications for:
     * Session opens/closes
     * Killzone entry/exit
     * Economic event countdown
   - Customizable lead time (5/10/15/30 minutes before event)
   - Alert history log
   - Snooze functionality
   - Alert preferences by session type
   - Sound notifications (optional)

   NOTIFICATION EXAMPLES:
   - "London Killzone opening in 10 minutes"
   - "High-impact news (NFP) in 15 minutes - Current: EUR/USD"
   - "New York session closing in 30 minutes"
   - "Asia-London overlap starting now"

   TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Use Web Notifications API (already PWA-ready)
   - Service worker for background notifications
   - New component: AlertManager.tsx
   - Store alert preferences in PostgreSQL user settings
   - Backend cron job or WebSocket for real-time triggering

   USER BENEFIT: Never miss critical trading opportunities, reduces screen
                 time stress, enables better work-life balance


4. NEWS DANGER ZONES VISUALIZATION
   ---------------------------------
   WHY: Your economic calendar shows events but doesn't help traders ACT on
        them. Professional advice: "Don't trade 30 minutes before/after major news."

   FEATURES:
   - Visual "danger zones" on chart timeline:
     * Red shaded areas 30 minutes before/after high-impact events
     * Orange zones for medium-impact events
   - Countdown timer to next major event (prominent display)
   - Trade recommendations based on event proximity:
     * "AVOID TRADING - NFP in 12 minutes"
     * "WAIT FOR BREAKOUT - FOMC decision passed 5 minutes ago"
     * "SAFE TO TRADE - Next high-impact event in 4 hours"
   - Historical event impact analysis:
     * "NFP average movement: 85 pips"
     * "FOMC average movement: 120 pips"
   - Event-specific pair recommendations

   DISPLAY INTEGRATION:
   - Overlay shaded zones on ForexChart timeline
   - Dedicated "Next Event" widget in header
   - Flashing warning when inside danger zone
   - Mobile-optimized countdown badge

   DATA LEVERAGE:
   - Your PostgreSQL database already has:
     * Event times (time_utc)
     * Impact levels (high/medium/low)
     * Event types (NFP, CPI, FOMC, etc.)
   - Just need to add historical pip movement data

   TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Enhance processedEvents in ForexChart.tsx
   - Add danger zone rendering logic
   - New component: NextEventCountdown.tsx
   - Backend: /api/calendar/danger-zones endpoint

   USER BENEFIT: Prevents getting "stopped out" by unexpected volatility,
                 improves timing of entries/exits, reduces emotional losses


5. CURRENCY CORRELATION MATRIX
   ----------------------------
   WHY: Prevents hidden risk exposure. When EUR/USD and GBP/USD both move
        together (+0.85 correlation), having positions in both means
        concentrated risk. One stop-loss often triggers both losses.

   FEATURES:
   - Real-time correlation heatmap (8x8 grid for major pairs)
   - Correlation scale: -1 (inverse) to +1 (perfect correlation)
   - Color coding:
     * Dark green: Strong positive correlation (+0.7 to +1)
     * Light green: Moderate positive (+0.3 to +0.7)
     * Gray: No correlation (-0.3 to +0.3)
     * Light red: Moderate negative (-0.7 to -0.3)
     * Dark red: Strong negative (-1 to -0.7)
   - Hover tooltips with explanation
   - Historical correlation trends (1 week, 1 month, 3 months)
   - Risk warnings: "WARNING: You have 3 highly correlated positions"

   MAJOR PAIRS TO TRACK:
   - EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF
   - AUD/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD
   - EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY

   CALCULATION METHOD:
   - Pearson correlation coefficient
   - Rolling 20-day or 50-day period
   - Update every hour or day

   DATA SOURCE:
   - Free forex APIs (Alpha Vantage, OANDA, Twelve Data)
   - Calculate manually from price data

   TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - New component: CorrelationMatrix.tsx
   - Backend calculation service
   - PostgreSQL table: currency_correlations
   - API endpoint: /api/correlation/matrix

   USER BENEFIT: Avoids overexposure to single currency movements,
                 better portfolio diversification, reduces unexpected losses
